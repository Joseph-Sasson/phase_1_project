This project is going to showcase how to add information about NBA teams and players from an API onto the browser. First we pulled the team names by conference and division and will add event listeners to pull up player names and their information.

# Main Deliverables
- Add a click event listener that pulls up player names from their respective teams when their team name is clicked.
- Add a click event listener that pulls up player information when that player name is clicked.
- Be able to search by team name.
- Add button event listener to go back to all team names.

# Bonus Deliverable
- Be able to search by player name.
- Be able to keep the team name that is clicked on the page while everything else disappears.
